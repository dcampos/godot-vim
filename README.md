# GodotVim

This project aims to bring Vim keybindings to Godot's script editor.

## Getting Started

The module at its current state isn't usable and much work has to be carried out in order to make it complete. If you want to try it out, just follow the steps below.


### Installing

First, clone my fork of Godot and set up your favorite C++ editor. The plugin currently works with Godot 2.1.


```
git clone -b 2.1 git@github.com:dcampos/godot.git
```

Clone godot-vim:

```
git clone git@github.com:dcampos/godot-vim.git
```

Copy or symlink the folder godot_vim of the plugin to the modules folder of the godot repository.
