# GodotVim

This project aims to bring Vim keybindings to Godot's script editor.

## Getting Started

The module at its current state is a work in progress and much has to be done in order to make it more usable. If you want to try it out, just follow the steps below.

### Installing

First, clone Godot to your local (and set up your favorite C++ editor if you want to mess with the code). The plugin currently works with Godot 2.1.


```
git clone -b 2.1 git@github.com:godotengine/godot.git
```

Clone godot-vim:

```
git clone git@github.com:dcampos/godot-vim.git
```

Copy or symlink the folder godot_vim of the plugin into the modules folder of the godot repository.
